            I am a passionate Full Stack Developer and an aspiring Computer
            Engineer with a relentless drive for innovation and problem-solving.
            My journey began with a curiosity for technology that soon turned
            into a passion for building meaningful digital experiences. From
            crafting seamless backend architectures to designing engaging
            frontend interfaces, I’ve honed my skills through hands-on
            internships, challenging personal projects, and constant learning.
            Currently in my final year at PICT College, I’m on a mission to
            tackle new challenges, explore uncharted territories in tech, and
            create solutions that make a difference. Every line of code I write
            is not just a function—it’s a step forward in my journey as a
            creator, learner, and innovator.

            My journey in tech began with a diploma in Computer Science, which
            set the foundation for my admission to PICT College, where I’m
            pursuing a BE in Information Technology. Over the years, I’ve gained
            valuable experience through internships at Barclays and Codefobe,
            where I developed key technical skills and collaborated on impactful
            projects. Beyond coding, I’m passionate about football and cricket,
            sports that have taught me the value of teamwork, coordination, and
            adaptability. I also have a keen interest in the stock market and
            artificial intelligence, constantly exploring new ways technology
            shapes our world. My diverse experiences fuel my drive to innovate
            and contribute to meaningful solutions in tech.

            During my internship, I developed a utility that automated the
            creation of Teradata scripts from SQL files, including DDLs,
            dbscripts, and BTEQ scripts. This innovation improved efficiency by
            80%, reducing processing time from 4-5 days to just a few hours,
            which significantly saved team effort. I also integrated the
            deployment process with Bitbucket, creating feature release branches
            to streamline workflow automation. This enhancement saved the team
            over 10 hours of manual work each month, making the overall
            deployment process much more efficient.

            implementation of a notifications feature that strategically
            targeted inactive users, significantly enhancing retention rates.
            Additionally, implemented captivating animations throughout the app,
            elevating the learning environment with game-like interactivity.
            Also enhanced the user experience by integrating a code editor

            app.
